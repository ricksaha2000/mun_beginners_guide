                        <p>Being a first timer in a Model United Nations conference, the rules of procedure are seemingly complicated, and honestly there is a lot to remember.</p>
                        <p>Let’s face it, being a diplomat can be a pain in the posterior unless you have the right guidance. And we take it upon ourselves to make every delegate right at home, regardless of their experience. So, what are we waiting for? Let us dive right in.</p>
                        <p>This guide will act like a mentor to any first timer guiding them through the entire rules of procedure fancifully called the ROP.
                            Time in any MUN committee is divided into three sections:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>when the council is adjourned/break,</li>
                            <li>formal debate,</li>
                            <li>informal debate.</li>

                        <h2>THE AGENDA</h2>
                        <p>Each committee is called upon to discuss a certain topic which is referred to as the agenda.</p>

                        <h2>ROLL CALL</h2>
                        <p>In simpler terms, the executive board calls out each country from the country matrix so that they can present their stance.</p>

                        <p>Either of the two stances can be opted by each delegate:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Present.<ul>
                                    <li>Delegates who have opted for this stance can abstain in substantive voting.</li>
                                    <li>They can always change their voting stance to the second.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Delegates who have opted for this stance cannot abstain in substantive voting.</li>
                                    <li>They cannot change their voting stance back.</li>
                                </ul>

                        </ol>
                        <h2>THE GENERAL SPEAKERS LIST</h2>
                        <p>The General Speakers List (GSL) is essentially the list of all delegates who wish to make a speech on the agenda
                            in general. The time given to an individual Delegate is usually 90 seconds to make his
                            speech and this duration can be extended by raising a motion as soon as roll call is done. Then the EB recognises speakers for the GSL with a show of respective placards. The GSL runs throughout the duration of the three days with
                            willing speakers adding their names to the list. If you wish to add your name to the GSL at a later point, you can do
                            so by sending a chit asking for your country/character to be added to the existing list.</p>

                <h2>INFORMAL DEBATE</h2>
                <p>Moving on from formal debate, we now deal with motions. A motion, as the name suggests, is used to move the proceedings of the committee into either informal debate from formal debate, or into a break. The EB asks for motions usually after 3 or 4 speeches are done or if they feel the need for a particular motion. Informal debate is divided into two parts, the Unmoderated Caucus and the Moderated Caucus. Unmoderated caucuses are slightly more disruptive (cause disturbance) in nature. Whereas, the moderated caucuses are a lot like the formal form of debate with sub agendas of the main Agenda.
                </p>
                <div class="features">
                    <section>
                        <span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
                        <h3>MODERATED CAUCUS</h3>
                        <p>The moderated caucus is basically where you discuss the sub-agendas of the overall agenda in the committee. For example, if the agenda is 'Pollution', then the sub agendas would be 'Air Pollution' or 'Water Pollution'.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in the earlier section, motion for a moderated caucus can be raised by following a verbatim/format, which is, “The delegate of [country name] would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate and move into a moderated caucus on the topic [sub agenda] for a total time period [total time] with individual speakers time being [individual speakers time] each”.</p>
                        <p>For example, “The delegate of Spain would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate and move into a moderated caucus on the topic “Water pollution” for a time period of 20 minutes, with individual speaker's time of 60 seconds”. This motion, if passed, establishes a moderated caucus that accomodates 20 speakers for a discussion on water pollution. Make sure that the total time period is exactly divisible by individual speakers time.</p>
                        <p>After various motions are raised by the delegates, the Executive Board sets them for a vote. This is a classic example of procedural voting, in which a 50% plus one of the members will have to agree (If the committee has 8 members, then 5 members have to agree on it or if the committee has 15 members, then 9 members have to agree on it.) Then the delegate who raised the moderated caucus will choose either to be the first or the last speaker.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <span class="icon solid major fa-users"></span>
                        <h3>UNMODERATED CAUCUS</h3>
                        <p>This is when the delegates are allowed to leave their seats and approach anyone in the committee. This time is usually reserved for lobbying (A word coming from the practise of Delegates to meet in the UN lobby to discuss various substantial issues, it means trying to talk someone into supporting your view), to reach a compromise or a consesus on various issues, and to plan the future course of action in the committee amongst themselves. The unmoderated caucus can be raised when the EB invites motions, it is raised using the verbatim “The Delegate of {Country Name} would like to suspend formal debate and move into an Unmoderated Caucus for a time period {Time Period}”, for example “The Delegate of India would like to raise a motion to suspend formal debate and move into an Unmoderated Caucus for a time period of 15 minutes." As the Unmoderated Caucus is the most disruptive, whenever the motion is raised by a delegate, it is almost always the one to be first voted upon.</p>
                        <p>During this while, the Delegates can get up from their seats, walk around the room, leave the council room, go and talk to anyone whether it be the Executive Board, any other delegate or any member of the Organising Committee. This is somewhat similar to a break however it is strongly adviced that this time should be used to plan the proceedings of the committee or to win over some other delegate to support your cause. As almost every Executive Board marks on the lobbying skills of a Delegate.</p>

                                <p>This point is raised when the delegate is in physical discomfort like when the speech of a fellow delegate is inaudible, if you are feeling cold, hot, wet or itchy or if you require any form of assistance from the organising committee.</p>

                                <p>If the delegate of USA calls Lucknow as the capital of India, it is expected from the other delegates to raise a point of order by quoting the statement made by the delegate of USA and giving the correction.

                                <p>During formal debate, if you yield your remaining time to points of information, other delegates will be allowed to ask you various questions on the speech you just made or the stance taken by your country.</p>

                                <p>Procedural Voting is done for changing the time
                                    limit for the GSL, passing of any motion, or for the temporary suspension of
                                    committees for the breaks. First the Executive Board asks for those who are in support of the motion,
                                    then those who oppose it. If there are any members who are in oppose the motion, the executive board
                                    asks for the those who are ‘For’ the motion, and those who are ‘Against’ it. For this round there is a
                                    requirement of 50% + 1 number of delegates to be for the motion for it to pass.
                                    In procedural voting no one can abstain, and it is absolutely compulsory for all the members of the room
                                    to vote.</p>

                                <p>After the three days of the committee are towards an end, after every country/group of countries have submitted their documentation. It is time for those documents to be put to vote. During the substantial voting only the member nations can vote, and often the observer nations are requested to leave the room. Usually the votes can be given in the following ways:</p>
                                <p>Yes: You are in favor of the document, and it is completely aligned to your foreign policy.</p>
                                <p>No: Your country does not wish for the document to be passed.</p>
                                <p>Yes with rights: You are in favor of the document, however you require time to explain to the committee why you are in favor of the document. This is usually done when the document endorses policies which are not aligned with the usual stance taken by the delegate in the committee or the foreign policy of the country. On discretion of the executive board, the delegate is given a certain time to make the his reasons clear.</p>
                                <p>No with rights: The delegate is not in favor of the document, however requires time to explain to the committee, why he is taking this particular stance. (Reread Yes with rights)</p>
                                <p>Abstain: The delegate is neither in favor of the document, nor against it. They wish to remain neutral in regard to the document. </p>

On the other hand, if you wish to make a speech which will require more than the allotted time, you can request the delegate whose name comes above you in the GSL to yield some time to you.

                                                Any one delegate or a bloc can write a draft resolution. It is a document that contains all the issues that the committee wants to solve along with their proposed solutions. It is usually written during unmoderated caucuses as a working paper and then compiled into a resolution. The draft resolution is usually written in points, with a certain style and grammar (Google how to write a resolution for a MUN). If a majority is obtained, the draft resolution becomes a resolution that is passed in the committee.

A press release is an official statement from the delegate of a country to the international press regarding the views of the nation regarding the agenda of the committee and their stand on it. These are simple releases and do not require voting unless the executive asks for it specifically.

It is a final paper which has solutions which are in agreement with the stance taken by all the delegates in the committee. It is difficult to pass a communique as it will fail even if a single member in the committee digresses. A communique usually passed is binding in nature. All the member nations of the council are bound by law to follow it.

Some committees in a conference require you to send a position paper beforehand. A position paper explains your country’s situation pertaining to the agenda of the committee. It is a document that contains your country’s policies and position in regards to the matter. A position paper is usually of one or two pages and contains your country’s official letterhead. It should be simple and should contains what your country has been doing and what it believes should be done to address the agenda. It should also contain how the agenda affects your country and your country’s history with the agenda.

During the proceedings of Security Council, in special cases, a standing, ad hoc committee is established to address to a particular issue. The committee is resolved as soon as the issue is under control. The details of the committee, including the budget, the background, the parties involved, the obligations, mandate, hierarchy are mentioned in a document.

In crisis committees, such as the Arab League, the delegates, usually, have executive authority over the military forces pertaining to certain restrictions. Essentially, they can move their troops, plan strategic, covert spy missions, tactical movements, propaganda missions etc. These are done through action orders, the format of which, will be provided in the background guide or by the executive board.
